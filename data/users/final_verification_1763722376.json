      "botResponse": "Hello! I can help you with storing dal to reduce waste.\n\n• Store cooked dal in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will last for 3-4 days.\n\n• For longer storage, freeze cooked dal in portions. It can last for up to 2 months.\n\n• Dry dal should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dark, and dry place. It can last for up to 1 year.\n\n• Consider making dal paratha (approx. 40 BDT) from leftover dal to prevent waste.\n\nReducing food waste helps lower greenhouse gas emissions in Bangladesh.\n\nNext step: Check your dal storage and ensure it's properly sealed.\n",
