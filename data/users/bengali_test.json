      "botResponse": "Oh no, that's a shame about your dal going bad! Let's see what we can do to prevent that in the future and how to best use dal.\n\n• **Main Suggestion:** Store dal properly. Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This can prevent spoilage for a longer time.\n• **Budget-Friendly Tip:** For moderate budgets, buy dal in smaller quantities more frequently from your local bazaar to ensure freshness. Look for options at Korail or Mohammadpur Krishi Market.\n• **Food Waste Reduction:** Consider making \"Dal Puri\" (Lentil Stuffed Flatbread) - a delicious way to use up dal before it spoils completely (Estimated cost: 40 BDT). This also helps reduce food waste.\n\nI can also help you with creative recipes using leftover ingredients. Would you like to explore that?\n",
