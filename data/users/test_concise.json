      "botResponse": "That's great! We can definitely put that rice to good use. Here are a few ideas:\n\n*   **Main Suggestion:** *Bhater Pulao* (পোলাও) - You can easily turn leftover rice into a flavorful pulao with some vegetables (around 50 BDT) and spices. It's a quick and satisfying meal.\n\n*   **Alternative 1:** *Bhaja Bhat* (ভাজা ভাত) - A simple fried rice with egg (15 BDT), onions, and chili. Very quick and easy!\n\n*   **Alternative 2:** *Rice Cutlets* (চালের চপ) - Mix the rice with mashed potatoes, spices, and shape into cutlets. Shallow fry them for a tasty snack (about 40 BDT).\n\nI can also help you create a budget meal plan or find creative recipes using other leftovers. Just let me know what you'd like to try!\n\nNext step: Try making bhaja bhat for dinner tonight!\n",
