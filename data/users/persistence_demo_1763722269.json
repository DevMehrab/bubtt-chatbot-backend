      "botResponse": "Hello! I can help you reduce food waste with proper storage techniques.\n\n• Cool the rice quickly: Spread the rice on a plate to cool it down faster, ideally within one hour.\n\n• Refrigerate promptly: Store the cooled rice in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Consume within 1-2 days.\n\n• Freezing: For longer storage, freeze the rice in a freezer-safe bag or container. It can last for up to 1 month.\n\n• Recipe to prevent waste: Make egg fried rice (approximately 30 BDT) the next day.\n\nReducing rice waste can lower methane emissions from landfills.\n\nNext step: Refrigerate your leftover rice properly for use within the next 1-2 days.\n",
