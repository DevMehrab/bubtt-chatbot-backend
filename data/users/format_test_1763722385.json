      "botResponse": "Hello! Here's how to store leftover biryani and reduce food waste:\n\n• Store leftover biryani in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It can last for 2-3 days.\n\n• Another option is to freeze the biryani in a freezer-safe container. It can last for up to 1 month.\n\n• You can transform leftover biryani into biryani cutlets. Mix the biryani with mashed potatoes, shape them into cutlets, and pan-fry them (estimated cost: 40 BDT).\n\nReducing food waste helps lower greenhouse gas emissions in Bangladesh.\n\nNext step: Refrigerate or freeze your biryani as soon as possible to prevent spoilage.\n",
