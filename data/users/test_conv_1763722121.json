      "botResponse": "Hello! I can help you with dal storage and waste reduction.\n\n• Store cooked dal in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days.\n\n• For dry dal, keep it in a cool, dark, and dry place, like a pantry, in an airtight container. This can extend its shelf life to 1-2 years.\n\n• You can make dal paratha using leftover dal. The cost would be approximately 40 BDT for one person.\n\nReducing food waste helps lower greenhouse gas emissions from landfills in Bangladesh.\n\nNext step: Check your dal supply and store it properly to prevent spoilage.\n",

      "botResponse": "Hello! I'm happy to help you with nutrition advice tailored for you.\n\n• Focus on incorporating more iron into your diet.\n\n• Two budget-friendly options include:\n    *  Spinach (Palak): Approximately 20 BDT per bundle.\n    *  Lentils (Dal): Approximately 80 BDT per kg.\n\nIron is essential for energy levels and overall health.\n\nNext step: Try adding spinach to your next dal dish to boost your iron intake affordably.\n",
