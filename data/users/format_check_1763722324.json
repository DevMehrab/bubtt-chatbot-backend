I'm here to help you reduce food waste.\n\nHere are some practical tips:\n\n• Proper Storage: Store vegetables in airtight containers in the refrigerator to extend their shelf life. Fruits like bananas can be kept in a cool, dark place.\n\n• Repurpose Leftovers: Use leftover vegetables to make a mixed vegetable curry (approx. 50 BDT).\n\nReducing food waste lessens environmental impact in Bangladesh.\n\nNext step: Start by properly storing your vegetables and fruits today.\n",
