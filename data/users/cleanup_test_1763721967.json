      "botResponse": "Hello! Here's a budget meal plan for you.\n\n• Lunch: Chicken Biryani (approx. 250 BDT) - a single serving is filling and provides protein and carbs.\n\n• Cheaper Alternative: Egg and Vegetable Khichuri (approx. 150 BDT) - equally nutritious and budget-friendly.\n\nShopping Tip: Buy vegetables from local markets for better prices.\n\nNext step: Plan to cook the Biryani and see if you have enough money for the rest of the week.\n",
