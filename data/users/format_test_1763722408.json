      "botResponse": "Hello! I can help you store your leftover biryani to prevent food waste.\n\n• Store leftover biryani in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will stay fresh for 2-3 days.\n\n• You can also freeze it in a freezer-safe container for up to 1 month.\n\n• To prevent waste, consider making biryani rice cakes (estimated cost: 40 BDT). Mix the leftover biryani with a beaten egg and some spices, form into small cakes, and pan-fry until golden brown.\n\nReducing food waste helps lower greenhouse gas emissions in Bangladesh.\n\nNext step: Store your biryani properly in the refrigerator to enjoy it later.\n",
