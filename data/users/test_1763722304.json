      "botResponse": "Hello! I can help you with rice storage tips.\n\n• Store cooked rice in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will last for 2-3 days.\n\n• Ensure the rice cools down before refrigerating to prevent moisture buildup.\n\n• You can also freeze cooked rice for longer storage (up to 1 month).\n\n• Recipe to prevent waste: Egg Fried Rice (approx. 30 BDT). This is a quick way to use leftover rice with readily available ingredients.\n\nReducing food waste helps lower greenhouse gas emissions from landfills.\n\nNext step: Refrigerate your rice properly to extend its shelf life.\n",
