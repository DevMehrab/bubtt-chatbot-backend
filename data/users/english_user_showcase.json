      "botResponse": "Okay, let's plan some budget-friendly meals for one person.\n\n• Main suggestion: A simple meal could be rice with lentil soup (dal) and a fried egg. This costs around 60 BDT. It's nutritious and filling.\n\n• Alternative 1: Vegetable khichuri (rice and lentil porridge with vegetables) - Approximately 70 BDT. This is a good source of fiber and vitamins.\n\n• Alternative 2: Rice with chicken curry and vegetables (around 120 BDT). Consider buying smaller portions of chicken to save money.\n\nShopping Tip: Buy vegetables and lentils from local markets; they're cheaper and fresher. This also reduces your carbon footprint by supporting local farmers.\n\nNext step: Try making the lentil soup with a fried egg for dinner tonight!\n",
